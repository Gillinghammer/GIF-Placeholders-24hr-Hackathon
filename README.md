WDI_Hackathon
=============

Hackathon project during the General Assembly course.

We were given 24 hours to create an app using any of the programming languages and frameworks we've learned to this point.

I created a GIF placeholder website, inspired by sites like placehold.it, placekitten.com and fillmurray.com where you can generate various sized placeholder images.
